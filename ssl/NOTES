TEST CERT ONLY

See https://serversforhackers.com/c/using-ssl-certificates-with-haproxy for the original example.

    openssl genrsa -out picluster.key 1024
    openssl req -new -key picluster.key -out picluster.csr
    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in picluster.csr -signkey picluster.key -out picluster.crt
    cat picluster.crt picluster.key | tee picluster.pem

CHECK WHETHER THE CERTIFICATE IS BEING PRESENTED

    gnutls-cli picluster:24

or:

    openssl s_client -showcerts -connect picluster:24


The latter will marginally function for accepting the self-signed certificate, and basic testing, 
however as it's not a telnet client, it's not acceptable for proper testing of SSL-wrapped telnet.

TESTING

On Windows, the ZOC7 ($$$) client can be used to connect. 

Ensure in the Session Profile that the following option is checked: 

	[x] Force TLS 1.2 as security protocol

Check that the traffic is truly encrypted with tcpdump at the haproxy: 

    tcpdump -X -i  any tcp port 24

(ensure the traffic is encrypted)
